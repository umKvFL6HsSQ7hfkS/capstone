        <h3> What We Do</h3>
        <p id="text"> Senior loneliness is an extremely prevelant issue
        in today's world. According to the CDC, senior citizens are likely 
        to suffer from social isolation as they often live alone, have experienced
        the loss of friends or family, and have chronic illnesses. 
        </p>

        <p id="text"> At Senior Services, we connect older folks to one another
        through various events and meet ups. We also provide shuttle services, 
        as we know mobility is also a major issue in this community.
